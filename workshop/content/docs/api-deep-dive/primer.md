# Primer

The deep dives will focus on numerous OGC API standards, starting from the foundational OGC API - Common, followed
by API implementations for various geospatial data types and workflows.  Discovery, access, visualization and
processing are core workflows in the geospatial domain.  The deep dives are designed for you to "dive deep" into
to better understand their purpose and applicability to your requirements/interests.

Each API deep dive will consist of the following components:

- Introduction: an overview of the API, its core functionality, and how it fits into the greater OGC API ecosystem
- Resources: a detailed description of each URL / endpoint supported by the API

!!! note
    "Resource" can be an overloaded term.
    The "Resources" section in each deep dive describe HTTP methods, URL paths/endpoints and explanations
    of functionality.
