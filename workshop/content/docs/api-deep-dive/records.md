# OGC API - Records

!!! abstract Audience
    Students that are familiar with web services and APIs, and want to have
    an overview of OGC API - Records standard.

!!! abstract "Learning Objectives"
    At the completion of the module students will be able to:

    - Explain what the OGC API - Records standard is
    - Describe what can be done with OGC API - Records implementations
    - Understand the main resources offered by OGC API - Records implementations
    - Understand how to retrieve a description of the capabilities of an
      OGC API - Records implementation
    - Understand how to issue requests to an implementation of OGC API - Records
    - Be able to find an OGC API - Records endpoint and use it through a client

## Introduction

OGC API - Records is a multi-part draft specification that offers the capability to
create, modify, and query metadata on the Web. The draft specification enables the
discovery of geospatial resources by standardizing the way collections of descriptive
information about the resources (metadata) are exposed.  The draft specification also
enables the discovery and sharing of related resources that may be referenced from
geospatial resources or their metadata by standardizing the way all kinds of records
are exposed and managed.  Part 1 covers read-only access to records and simple query
capabilities.  Additional capabilities that address specific needs will be specified
in additional parts. Capabilities for richer queries or to create, update or delete
records will be specified in additional parts.


### Background

> History

  The OGC API - Records standard is a successor to the OGC's Catalogue Service
  for the Web (CSW) standard, focusing on simple reusable REST API
  building blocks which can be described using the OpenAPI
  specification.

> Versions

  **OGC API - Records - Part 1: Core** is currently in draft and is planned to be
  submitted to the OGC Architecture Board (OAB) in December 2023 for public review
  in Q1 2024.

> Test Suite

  There are no test suites currently implemented; they will be made available once
  the specification is approved, and an executable test suite (ETS) is made availabe
  as per of OGC CITE.

>  Implementations

  Implementations can be found on the implementations page: <https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-records/blob/master/implementations.md>
