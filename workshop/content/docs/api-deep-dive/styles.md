## Introduction

[OGC API - Styles](https://ogcapi.ogc.org/styles) is a standard that describes an API that enables map servers, clients as well as visual style editors, to manage and fetch styles. The styles consist of symbolizing instructions that can be applied by a rendering engine on features and/or coverages. The API implements the conceptual model for style encodings and style metadata.

!!! note
    This tutorial module is not intended to be a replacement to the actual
    **OGC API - Styles - Part 1: Core** standard. The tutorial intentionally
    focuses on a subset of capabilities in order to get the student started
    with using the standard. Please refer to the [**OGC API - Styles - Part 1:
    Core** standard](https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/20-009.html) for additional detail.
